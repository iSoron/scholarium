# Scholarium

Scholarium allows you to visualize scientific papers and their citations
graphically, as a network, making it easy to get a big picture of a research
field, identify clusters of closely related articles and find important papers
to read.

Each node of the network corresponds to a paper and each link corresponds to a
citation. Papers with many citations are represented as large nodes. The data
is fetched in real time from *Scopus* or *Web of Science*.

<sub>This software is in alpha stage. Expect occasional bugs and incomplete features. Suggestions and pull requests are very welcome.</sub>
